This project will be using the 'ufo-data' files in this same folder

We will initially do some mundane statistical analysis on the data to find any patterns

If we do see some patterns in the data, we can build our analysis out around that concept and try to establish a link between otherwise independent variables/atributes

Otherwise let's just have some fun with it 


Data breakdown:
The data inside of the files is UFO sightings within the US, that's about it 
The columns of the csv file include info based on when the sighting was recorded and where
Some of these entries may already be debunked and can't honeslty be taken seriously, but whatever, it's still usable data
We have 1000 data entries so far (and that might be the upper limit honestly)
